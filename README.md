### Hi there 👋🏻 My name is [Ali](https://www.malikdraz.io).

I’m all about the speed and simplicity of Go and Python, always aiming to write code that’s clean and efficient.

Outside of coding, you’ll find me wrangling Kubernetes clusters and turning containerized chaos into smooth-running systems. I’m a big fan of Docker too, constantly experimenting with new ways to build and scale apps.

Whether it’s open-source contributions or tackling real-world problems, my motto is: build with purpose, deploy with confidence.

Come along as I dive into the ever-changing world of AWS, Kubernetes, Go, Python, and everything container-related!
